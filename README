SSORM PHP
Super Simple Object Relational Mapper

A quick and easy way to manage objects in PHP
No fancy installs, just upload and go.

Also, I hope this is a good learning tool for learning about dealing with
objects in PHP 5.

Add and delete slides and subslides as you like, but please be appropriate in
your comments, I want this to be a friendly environment!!

NOTE! Current version comes with 2 related models, slides and subslides

INSTRUCTIONS
To install, simply rename the file config/db_config.php.tmp to db_config.php
(leave it in the config directory)
Then point your browser to (root)/config/db_tables.php and it will automatically
migrate (add the tables) for you! You can, of course edit the db_tables.php
file to change the data tables you want to use...
